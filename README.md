# spacemy-sourcecode
Source code for https://spacemy.cubebuilder.cf
# Setup
I strongly recommend to use NGINX and not Apache
Clone the repo ```https://github.com/spacemy2/spacemy-sourcecode.git```
Change server_name on the nginx.conf to your domain
Make sure php is installed on your linux/windows machine

make sure you setup ssl with certbot and not the shitty fake cloudflare ssl
